#This pipeline used to construct the duck linear pan-genome using a combination approach of Psvcp and PPsPCP pipelines.
#Five published duck genomes were used to construct the duck pan-genome, which consists of three Pekin duck genomes, one Shaoxing duck genome, and mallard duck genome.
#Briefly, duckbase.refseq.v4 genome was aligned to the initial reference genome (ZJU1.0), insertions longer than 50 bp were then identified and placed in the ZJU1.0. This process was further iterated by CAU_Pekin2.0, CAU_Laying_1.0, and ASM8764695v1 in an order of increasing phylogenetic distance to ZJU1.0
